/**
 * The Appearance screen (PLAN.md D-059, D-157): a bar, the picture, and an inspector that
 * opens on a home — where to start from, how much is the owner's own, the six sections —
 * and goes into one section at a time.
 *
 * SECTIONS, NOT TABS. Six tabs held seventy controls in a 312px column, the five widths sat
 * in four of them, and the characters had a column of their own the picture needed. Now the
 * home lists the sections with a line saying what each holds, every width is in one of
 * them, and the characters are tiles at the top of the home.
 *
 * WITHOUT JAVASCRIPT IT IS ONE COLUMN: the home, then every section under it, each row of the
 * home's list a link down to its section, every group a <details> already open, every reset a
 * plain submit. appearance-sections.js turns that into views, one at a time, with the
 * browser's Back going from a section to the home. Nothing is only reachable with a script.
 *
 * @var array<string, string> $decisions
 * @var array<string, string> $errors keyed by the decision or the field at fault
 * @var list<string> $changed the keys the owner has made theirs over $basis (D-158)
 * @var string $basis the character the screen measures against
 * @var string $character character loaded into the form, '' when none
 * @var \App\Core\Blocks $chromeBlocks the header and footer blocks, whose layouts draw their arrangements (D-166)
 * @var string $title
 * @var string $csrf
