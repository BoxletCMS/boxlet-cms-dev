/**
 * Every character a site can choose, wherever it comes from (PLAN.md D-152): those
 * Boxlet ships in designs/core/, sets an owner dropped into designs/custom/ over FTP
 * (D-155), and sets imported in the admin, kept in design_characters (migration 0032).
 *
 * WHAT A CHARACTER IS lives in its file now, not in PHP: the decisions it makes, the
 * header and footer it gives, the composition it gives a page. This is the one reader of
 * all three, read once per request; Presets, Composition and ChromeLook ask it.
 *
 * CORE IS TRUSTED, NOT VALIDATED, AS IT LOADS. Tokens::validate() falls back to the default
 * character, so validating the characters on the way in would call itself. The core files
 * are held instead by a test: Tokens::validate() and DesignSet::parse() read each without an
 * error, a warning or a changed value (characters_test.php). Everything else is read
 * through DesignSet::parse(), and a file it refuses is left out — never the site.
 *
 * Precedence when two share an id: core, then custom, then imported. A custom file or an
 * imported set that cannot be used is noted in skipped(), which the Appearance screen shows
 * as a notice. An import never takes an id that is in use: addImported() gives it `-2`,
 * `-3`… so a second `soft` cannot replace the first, or the one Boxlet ships.
