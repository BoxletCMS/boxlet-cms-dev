 * its composition, its header and footer — is in designs/core/*.json and the sets an owner
 * adds, and Characters is the one reader of them.
 *
 * The five Boxlet ships differ in structure, not only hue. Tokens change type, text size,
 * scale, spacing, radius, shadow, content width and surface contrast; composition changes
 * the shape of the page itself: measure, vertical rhythm, alignment, section boundaries and
 * hero arrangement. Every one derives its whole palette and nudges nothing: a colour set by
 * hand, a nudged step, a colour of its own are the owner's exceptions (D-063, D-066, D-076),
 * which a set an owner imports may carry (D-153) and one Boxlet ships does not.
