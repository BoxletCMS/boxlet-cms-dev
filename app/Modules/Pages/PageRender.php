 * builder's canvas shows.
 *
 * THREE CALLERS, ONE DRAWING. The visitor's page and the Appearance preview were one drawing
 * since D-168 (PageBody); the canvas ran the same loop by hand, with the editor's marks added.
 * They draw a document now — the stored page, or the draft when one exists — so a draft is
 * drawn by the very code that will draw it once it is published.
 *
 * Every picture, link, form and file the page refers to is resolved up front, one query each,
 * so a template is handed what it needs and never queries.
