 * NO FREE VALUE ANYWHERE. A surface is one of the three the sections already use, so the
 * palette's contrast guarantee holds for the chrome exactly as it does for a block; the
 * rest are sizes and arrangements the stylesheet has a rule for, nothing more.
 *
 * STORED AS "FOLLOW THE CHARACTER" UNLESS CHOSEN. An empty setting means the character
 * decides, so changing character re-dresses the chrome the way it re-composes a page,
 * while a choice the owner made stays theirs. The same split the Design screen draws
 * between a character's defaults and the decisions saved over them.
