 * THE VISITOR'S STYLESHEETS AS ONE FILE (PLAN.md D-204). Every page of a site links the same
 * nineteen sheets; a browser on a first visit fetched each before it drew anything, and on a
 * cPanel host Lighthouse put that at 1.2 s. One file, cache/site.<hash>.css, made from them in
 * this order the first time a page asks for it, so the cascade is theirs unchanged, and named
 * by a hash of what it holds, so a browser may keep it a year (D-203) and a change is a new
 * address.
 *
 * Read from the code's own public/assets, which ships with it; written beside tokens.css. A
 * relative url() in a sheet is relative to assets/, and is given the way there from cache/.
 * A bundle this replaces is removed only once no kept page can still name it (PageCache's
 * day); a folder that cannot be written gives '' and the layout links the nineteen as before.
