/*
 * The Appearance inspector's views (PLAN.md D-157): the home, and one section at a time.
 *
 * The markup ships as ONE COLUMN — the home, then every section under it — and the home's
 * rows are links down the page to their sections. Without this file that is the screen, and
 * every control is reachable. With it, the home and each section are views shown one at a
 * time, and the address says which: #view-header for a section, nothing for the home.
 *
 * NOT THE SECTIONS' OWN IDS. An address naming an element is one the browser scrolls to when
 * the page finishes loading, and it did: the inspector came up scrolled past the question at
 * its top (measured, 186px, after a character load). #view-* names no element, so the
 * address records the view and the browser leaves the scroll alone.
 *
 * BACK GOES HOME, NOT OFF THE SCREEN. Opening a section from the home pushes one entry, so
 * the browser's Back returns to the home; the section's own "All settings" link goes back
 * through that entry rather than adding another. A section restored on load is pushed over a
 * home entry for the same reason.
 *
 * WHICH SECTION A LOAD RESTORES. Every button on this screen posts it, and the answer is the
 * whole screen again; the owner who pressed a reset in Header expects to be in Header after
 * it. So the view is noted as the form is sent, and taken back once by the page that answers.
 * Arriving any other way — from the admin's menu, a link, a bookmark — opens the home.
 *
 * THE SECTION WITH THE PROBLEM OPENS BY ITSELF. A refused publish puts its messages beside
 * the controls at fault, and a message inside a view that is not shown is a message nobody
 * reads.
